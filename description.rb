<div><p>&nbsp;When you need to operate on a Ruby <code class="inline">Array</code>, you can accomplish just about anything you can imagine with the <code class="inline">each</code> method. Often, though, using <code class="inline">each</code> is not the best way to work with <code class="inline">Array</code>.</p>
<p>For example, when you find yourself adding conditional logic inside your <code class="inline">each</code> block, or using <code class="inline">each</code> to search, sort, or transform the <code class="inline">Array</code>, consider the power of Ruby’s <code class="inline">Enumerable</code> module.</p>
<p>Constraint: <strong>do not use the <code class="inline">for</code> or <code class="inline">each</code> method</strong> in any of your solutions to this challenge. Besides these two, any other enumerable method is up for grabs!</p>
  <h3>Task</h3>
  <h4>Utilize Enumerable’s methods</h4>
  <p>Enumerable is full of useful, convenient methods that make working with enumerables much simpler. This exercise will expose you to a handful of these methods. Each method in the exercise tells you which Enumerable method you should use, so it’s your job to figure out how to call it to perform the desired task. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Note: Be careful not to break the driver code.</p>
